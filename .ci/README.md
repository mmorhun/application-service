# Application Service CI documentation

Currently in application-service all tests are running in [Openshift CI](https://prow.ci.openshift.org/?job=*application*service*).

## Openshift CI

Openshift CI is a Kubernetes based CI/CD system. Jobs can be triggered by various types of events and report their status to many different services. In addition to job execution, Openshift CI provides GitHub automation in a form of policy enforcement, chat-ops via /foo style commands and automatic PR merging.

All documentation about how to onboard components in Openshift CI can be found in the Openshift CI jobs [repository](https://github.com/openshift/release). All application-service jobs configurations are defined in https://github.com/openshift/release/tree/master/ci-operator/config/mmorhun/application-service.
